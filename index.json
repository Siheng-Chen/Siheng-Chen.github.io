interactions among multiple agents from their past trajectories is fundamental to precise and interpretable trajectory prediction. However, previous works only consider pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling for relational reasoning, we propose GroupNet, a multiscale hypergraph neural network, which is novel in terms of both interaction capturing and representation learning. From the aspect of interaction capturing, we propose a trainable multiscale hypergraph to capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions at multiple group sizes. From the aspect of interaction representation learning, we propose a three-element format that can be learnt end-to-end and explicitly reason some relational factors including the interaction strength and category. We apply GroupNet into both CVAE-based prediction system and previous state-of-the-art prediction systems for predicting socially plausible trajectories with relational reasoning. To validate the ability of relational reasoning, we experiment with synthetic physics simulations to reflect the ability to capture group behaviors, reason interaction strength and interaction category. To validate the effectiveness of prediction, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world trajectory prediction datasets, including NBA, SDD and ETH-UCY; and we show that with GroupNet, the CVAE-based prediction system outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that adding GroupNet will further improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art prediction systems.\nResult On the relational reasoning Visualization of learnt group behavior. (a) The particle trajectories containing a three-group with a light bar, a two-group with a spring and an individual particle. (b) The heatmap of the learnt affinity matrix via affinity modeling. (c) The multiscale hypergraph topology via hyperedge forming and the interaction category vector of each hyperedge. The red box represents the three-group and two-group we inferred. Particles’ trajectories and the curve of neural interaction strength with particle’s electric charge. We see that the neural interaction strength has a proportional relationship with the amount of charge, reflecting our model is capable to implicitly capture the interaction strength in an unsupervised manner. Visualization results on the NBA dataset. We plot the best trajectory among 20 predictions for the state-of-the-art method (NMMP), GroupNet with the CVAE framework (Ours) and ground truth (GT). The red/blue color represents players of two teams and the green color represents the basketball. Light color represents the past trajectory.

However, in this way, the model parameters come from all seen instances, which means a huge amount of irrelevant seen instances might also involve in predicting the current situation, disturbing the performance. To provide a more explicit link between the current situation and the seen instances, we imitate the mechanism of retrospective memory in neuropsychology and propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach that predicts the movement intentions of agents by looking for similar scenarios in the training data. In MemoNet, we design a pair of memory banks to explicitly store representative instances in the training set, acting as prefrontal cortex in the neural system, and a trainable memory addresser to adaptively search a current situation with similar instances in the memory bank, acting like basal ganglia. During prediction, MemoNet recalls previous memory by using the memory addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We further propose a two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step is to leverage MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step is to fulfill the whole trajectory according to the predicted destinations. Experiments show that the proposed MemoNet improves the FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3% from the previous best method on SDD/ETH-UCY/NBA datasets. Experiments also show that our MemoNet has the ability to trace back to specific instances during prediction, promoting more interpretability.\nResult Diverse intention prediction by MemoNet on SDD, where 20 final intentions are clustered from 120 coarse intention anchors. MemoNet can provide diverse and accurate intention predictions.\nPrediction cases with corresponding past-future trajectories traced by memory addresser. MemoNet promotes a more explicit link between the current situation and seen instances.\nCitation @InProceedings{MemoNet_2022_CVPR, author = {Xu, Chenxin and Mao, Weibo and Zhang, Wenjun and Chen,
